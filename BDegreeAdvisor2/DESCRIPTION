Description: This package helps Brown students navigate different concentration requirements, semester schedules, and career opportunities by compiling concentration requirements and semesters in which these courses are available into an easy-to-read table, creating a table that compares the courses that are required in two concentrations and the total number of requirements for each one, putting together a schedule of available required courses by comparing the concentration requirements with the courses available in any particular semester, and developing a table that includes job opportunities by location, salary, job title and description.
