Description: This package helps Brown students navigate different concentration requirements, semester schedules, and career opportunities by: 
(1) Compiling concentration requirements and semesters in which these courses are available into an easy-to-read table, 
(2) Creating a table that compares the courses that are required in two concentrations and the total number of requirements for each one.
(3) Putting together a schedule of available required courses by comparing the concentration requirements with the courses available in any particular semester.
(4) Developing a table that includes job opportunities by location, salary, job title and description.
