#' conc_rec Function
#'
#' This function takes the concentration of interest as an input and returns a 
# table with all the required classes for that particular concentration.
#' @param conc.name:concentration name as it appears in the list of Brown concentrations in the 
#' website: "https://bulletin.brown.edu/the-college/concentrations/". The input is not case 
#' sensitive. **conc.name is a character string, so it needs to go with "". 
#' @return Table of all the required courses for the concentration inputed.
#' @examples
#' conc_rec("Economics")
#' conc_rec("mathematics)
#' conc_rec("Math")
#' conc_rec("Africana Studies")
